There's the\n[gulp-browserify](https://github.com/deepak1556/gulp-browserify) and\n[gulpify](https://github.com/hughsk/gulpify) plugins, which you can use in\ncombination with gulp to get browserify working in your build. Unfortunately,\nthese plugins come with additional overhead: an extra GitHub repository, npm\nmodule, maintainer, tests, semantics, etc. It's much simpler\nin this case to use the original module directly where you can, which is what\n`vinyl-source-stream` handles for you.\n\n## Usage ##\n\n[![vinyl-source-stream](https://nodei.co/npm/vinyl-source-stream.png?mini=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/vinyl-source-stream)\n\nOur previous example, browserify, has a streaming API for its output bundles\nwhich you can use directly. This module is just a bridge that makes it\nsimple to use conventional text streams such as this in combination with gulp.\nHere's an example of using `vinyl-source-stream` and `browserify`, compared to\nusing `gulpify`:\n\n``` javascript\nvar source = require('vinyl-source-stream')\nvar streamify = require('gulp-streamify')\nvar browserify = require('browserify')\nvar uglify = require('gulp-uglify')\nvar gulpify = require('gulpify')\nvar gulp = require('gulp')\n\n// using gulpify:\ngulp.task('gulpify', function() {\n  gulp.src('index.js')\n    .pipe(gulpify())\n    .pipe(uglify())\n    .pipe(gulp.dest('./bundle.js'))\n})\n\n// using vinyl-source-stream:\ngulp.task('browserify', function() {\n  var bundleStream = browserify('index.js').bundle()\n\n  bundleStream\n    .pipe(source('index.js'))\n    .pipe(streamify(uglify()))\n    .pipe(gulp.dest('./bundle.js'))\n})\n```\n\nNot all that different, really! The nice thing here is that you're getting the\nup-to-date browserify API and don't have to worry about the plugin's available\nfunctionality. Of course, these same benefits apply for any readable text\nstream you can find on npm.\n\n## API ##\n\n### `stream = sourceStream([filename])` ###\n\nCreates a through stream which takes text as input, and emits a single\nvinyl file instance for streams down the pipeline to consume.\n\n`filename` is a \"pretend\" filename to use for your file, which some streams\nmight use to determine various factors such as the final filename of your file.\nIt should be a string, and though recommended, using this argument is optional.\n\n## License ##\n\nMIT.
